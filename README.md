    Imagine manipulation through applying filters such as:
    <br>
    - sharpen
    <br>
    - emboss
    <br>
    - detail
    <br>
    - GaussianBlur
    <br>
    - edge_enhance_more
    <br>
    - smooth_more
    <br>
    - unsharpMask
    <br>
    - minFilter
    <br>
    - maxFilter
    <br>
    - medianFilter
    <br><br>
    These filters were applied to an image. Additionally, the code includes histograms, statistics, and compares them.
